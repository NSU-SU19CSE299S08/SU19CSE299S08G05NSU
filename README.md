<h3><b>3.3 Proposed but Not Implemented Features: </b></h3>

- Shop Location: We had proposed that we will implement a feature that will show the book shop location in the google map but could not complete this feature within this deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

<h2><b>4. Technology : </b></h2>
<h3><b>4.1 Front-End : </b></h3>

- <b>HTML :</b> We have used this technology to create the structure of the website. We used its tags to let the browser know what actually we are trying to build.

- <b>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) :</b> To design a particular website, CSS is important technology. We have used it to design our interactive website.

- <b>Bootstrap (CSS Framework) :</b> We have used it in some webpages of this website. It is CSS Framework. It is lot easier than raw CSS. By only using its classes we designed our website.

- <b>JavaScript :</b> We used this technology to validate our forms. For previewing image before uploading to the website, we have used this technology.

- <b>JQuery :</b> It is JavaScript library which helps us to implement more feature with less code. We used it for some specific click events.

<br/>

<h3><b>4.2 Back-End : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">To store data into the database, we used two technologies. They are-

   </p>

- PHP: It is an OOP language. It works in our website as middle man. It fetches data from the database to show in the website.

- MySQL: MySQL is a popular database software for local development. That’s why we included as one of technology for our website.

  <h3><b>5.2 Week - 02 : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">In this week, we presented our ideas to our teacher. We have presented multiple ideas in front of our teacher and he choose one project for us. We were also instructed to make a project proposal for our project and to create folder structure in the GitHub repository.</p>

  <h3><b>5.3 Week - 03 : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">We made our project proposal and gave it our teacher. Initially, the project proposal was rejected for alignment issue. We also did not create the folder structure for the project. So we got a new deadline for the project proposal to submit with some penalty.</p>

  <h3><b>5.4 Week - 04 : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">In this week, we had submitted our project proposal and sir accepted it. During this week, we have work on two issues.  We worked on our database connection and created menu bar for the User Interface.</p>

  <h3><b>5.5 Week - 05 : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">During this time, we have worked on sign up integration with PHP. By signing up in this website, user will have best experience of this website. We also worked on our form validation. We used vanilla.js for validating our form. Created two UI page for the website.</p>

  <h3><b>5.7 Week - 07 : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">We worked on feature called book entry form. This feature is only available for book shop’s owner. Using this feature, the book shop owner will be able to add new books to his shop’s profile.</p>

  <h3><b>5.8 Week - 08 : </b></h3>
<p align="justify">After working on the sign up feature we started to work on the sign in feature. By using this feature, user will be able to login to the website to see how many books the owner have. Another feature we have worked on is Shop Registration Form.  </p>

- <p align="justify">CSS: CSS can be install in website in many ways. The best way is to create an external css file with .css extension and link this file to the html file. The structure to add css file in the HTML page is -
    <link type=”text/css” rel=”stylesheet” href=”css/style.css”?/></p>

- <p align="justify">Bootstrap: We can install bootstrap by using CDN and the other way is to add the hard coded css into our website like a css file.
- JavaScript and JQuery: Developer can write JavaScript by using an external file like css or the developer can install it by writing code in the html page by using script tag.</p>

<h3><b>7.2 Project Installation : </b></h3>

<p align='justify'>To install our project in a local machine, you must have the Xampp software install in your local machine. By using this software, you have to install database in your local machine. Then download the zip folder from the GitHub repository. The database you will find it in the project folder. Then unzip the folder and make sure you keep everything as it is. Do not change any directory otherwise it will show error. After installing the xampp software you must turn on the apache server and MySQL server. After turning on the servers, go to browser and type</p>

http://localhost/phpmyadmin

 <p align='justify'>This will take you to the database. You will find an option called import. Using this function, you will be import the database that is in the project code folder. After importing the database, take the project folder in this directory- C:\xampp\htdocs and upload it in the htdocs folder. Then go to the browser and type </p>

http://localhost/htdocts/project-name

   <p align='justify'>If you have done everything correctly, the project will run automatically.
